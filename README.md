# lightyearsjs

Light Years is inspired by the classic French card game Mille Bornes, in which two to four players race to be the first to travel 1000 miles while thwarting other players with accidents and engine problems. 

This iteration of Light Years is text-based and explores the basic logic of the game before I build the complete
version in Meteor. This project has been integral in my understanding of JavaScript and Javascript design patterns. While grappling with how to build this game, I've developed a keen understanding of how all the smaller parts of a computer program come together to form a cohesive whole. 

On a more basic level, the project has given me valuable experience programming strictly with vanilla JavaScript, working with and accessing objects and arrays, using constructors and factory functions, and understanding scope and closures as well as testing and debugging.
